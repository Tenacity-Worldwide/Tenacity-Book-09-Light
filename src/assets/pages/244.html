There are a </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20c6 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">number of other foods valuable for the protein they contain. For example, fish, cheese, beans and nuts are all </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20c7 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">rich in protein. Generally, we do not lack carbohydrates in our diet. Yam, cassava, bread, rice, potatoes and </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20c8 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">sugar all provide us with energy-giving food. But we should eat fresh fruit, such as oranges, guavas, bananas </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20c9 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and mangoes, as well as fresh vegetables, such as spinach and other green leaves, carrots and pumpkins, if </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20ca ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">we are to get enough vitamins to protect our bodies from illness.

When it enters the body it destroys the immune </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y211d ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">system, which protects our bodies against disease. The virus works slowly and it may be many years before a </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y211e ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">person carrying it becomes ill. When the person becomes very ill with many diseases, then they have AIDS and </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y211f ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">will probably die.</div><div class="t m0 x22 h20 y2120 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">The virus is transmitted or passed from person to person through body fluids like blood, semen and </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2121 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">vaginal fluid. It is not transmitted through vomit, urine, faeces or pus.</div><div class="t m0 x22 h20 y2122 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">HIV is usually transmitted when two people have sex. That is why it is very important not to have sex with </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2123 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">anyone unless both you and that person have had an HIV test. You must be in a strong long-term relationship </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2124 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and you must be certain the other person (and you) is not having sex with anyone else. However, sex is not the </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2125 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">only way in which HIV is transmitted from person to person. Using a syringe or a razor that has been recently </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2126 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">used by someone with HIV, or being in a road accident with someone with HIV,can put you at risk. Also, some </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2127 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">babies born to mothers with HIV may be born with the virus. It is one of the many myths about HIV to think </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2128 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">that having sex with a virgin is safe. HIV is not spread by other normal everyday contact with a person such as </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2129 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">touching or kissing or sharing cups and plates.</div><div class="t m0 x22 h20 y212a ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">When a person is HIV positive they should not give up hope. To some extent how long they can stay </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y212b ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">healthy is up to them. By eating well, taking exercise and getting plenty of rest, by getting quick treatment </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y212c ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">for any illnesses and thinking positively, they may not get AIDS for many years. Making plans and living life </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y212d ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">to the full are an important part of this. Anti-retroviral drugs can delay AIDS even further. All this means that </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y212e ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">someone with HIV may have many healthy years.</div><div class="t m0 x22 h20 y212f ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">A person with HIV will sometimes feel depressed. You can help them by being a good friend, by listening </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2130 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and offering support and cheering them up when they need it. You can also help them stick to their healthy </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2131 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">lifestyle by eating healthy food with them and doing sports with them. A person with HIV who feels well may </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2132 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">want to have sex if they meet someone they like. There are two things to remember: firstly, they may re-infect </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2133 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">themselves with the virus and this may mean they get AIDS quickly. Also, they must tell their boy or girlfriend </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2134 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">about their HIV. Using condoms can help to prevent the spread of the virus but it is not 100 per cent safe. It is </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2135 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">better to abstain from sex if you are HIV positive.</div><div class="t m0 x27 h1c y2136 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">B5.9 Study skills </div><div class="t m0 x27 h1c y2137 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Exercise 5</div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2138 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Once upon a time a rabbit was walking in a wood and a fox saw him. The fox was hungry and said, “Come </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2139 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">here, little rabbit. I want to give you a present.” But the rabbit ran away and jumped down a well. The fox </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y213a ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">could not catch the rabbit, but the rabbit could not get out of the well.  </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y213b ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">“Oh dear!” said the rabbit. “How can I get out of this well?” Then the rabbit had an idea. She shouted up to </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y213c ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the fox, “There’s a lot of food down here. Come down and get some, Mrs Fox.”</div></div><div class="t m0 xd h12 y14 ffc6 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls1 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG9_0247_Z01.indd   238<span class="_ _197"> </span>28/3/11   10:20:17 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
