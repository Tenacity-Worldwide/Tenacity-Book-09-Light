One day, when preparing food for </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1038 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 407.684px;">her family, Kibnash made a few extra injera, </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1039 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 393.681px;">which she sold on the streets. Word soon got </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 379.678px;">round, and a local hotel asked her to make </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103b ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 365.675px;">injera for them. But the problem was that </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103c ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 351.672px;">Kibnash was limited in how many she could make because she could not afford to buy much grain </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103d ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 337.669px;">or firewood. So she went to the local loan-sharks and borrowed a little money from them, even </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y103e ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 323.666px;">though their rates of <a onclick="showDictionary('interest'); return false;">interest</a> were very high.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y103f ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 309.663px;">Then a local <a onclick="showDictionary('credit union'); return false;">credit union</a> began. “You could get a loan, but you had to save for six months first,” </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1040 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 295.66px;">Kibnash said. “I couldn’t afford the two birr every week, but I managed, borrowing from friends </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1041 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 281.657px;">when I didn’t have the money.” </div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y1042 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 267.654px;">Six months later she was allowed to apply for a loan – worth ten times her savings, so long as </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1043 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 253.651px;">the <a onclick="showDictionary('credit union'); return false;">credit union</a> approved of her business plan. With the money, she bought teff in bulk at half the </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1044 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 239.648px;">price she had paid previously, and began to work full time. The hotel wanted all she could produce, </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1045 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 225.645px;">so she took on an assistant.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y1046 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 211.642px;">Kibnash proved to be an acute businesswoman. After a year she realised she had outgrown the </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1047 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 197.639px;">hotel and switched to providing snacks for a nearby school that had 3,000 students. For four years it </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1048 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 183.636px;">brought an increased profit, but as the number of pupils at the school changed and the rent there </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y1049 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 169.633px;">rose, business fell away. She decided to change her business again.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h20 y104a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 155.63px;">“I had been increasing my savings and my loans as the years went by.
