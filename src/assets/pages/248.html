Addis is the largest city in Ethiopia, with a population of around </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21cc ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">3 million. It is often called <span class="ffc4">the capital of Africa</span>, because of its historical, diplomatic and political importance </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21cd ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">for the continent. Many people from different regions of Ethiopia live in the city, which has recently had a </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21ce ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">construction boom with tall buildings rising up everywhere. There are more educated, middle class people </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21cf ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">living in Addis now than at any other time. The architecture is as varied as the city itself. Tall office buildings, </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d0 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">elegant villas, functional bungalows, flats, fashionable hotels, conference halls, shopping malls and theatres, </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d1 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">many of which have gleaming marble and metal clad walls, catch your attention. These modern buildings </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d2 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">contrast with the traditional homes of wattle and daub, roofed with corrugated iron patched with plastic bags </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d3 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and surrounded by cattle, sheep, goats, and chickens, which are set outside the compound walls of the larger </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d4 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">buildings. The city is not divided into rich and poor neighbourhoods; over half of the population of Addis lives </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d5 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">in slums. Beggars set up a regular pitch outside churches and on street corners, but traffic lights are prized as </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d6 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">prime spots from which to make enough money to feed their children. Daily life in Addis begins before dawn. </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d7 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Each morning, the smoke of cooking fires finds its way through the many gaps in the roofs. By night, the </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d8 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">sounds of families going early to bed gives way to the howling and barking of dogs across the city, driven to </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21d9 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">distraction by the hyenas coming down from the mountain to scavenge under cover of dark. </div><div class="t m0 x27 h87 y21da ffbf fs3e fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">UNIT 8 Money and finance</div><div class="t m0 x27 h1c y21db ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls5f ws0">A8.2 The importance of money</div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y21dc ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Money is important in many ways.
