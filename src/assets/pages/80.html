But my </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y4bd ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">brother, who did not like oranges, used to hate the work and always did it badly. In fact, he used </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y4be ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">to do it so badly that Mother seldom asked him to help her. When I was tired, Mother used to bring </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y69e ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">out her little sharp knife. She took an orange from the basket we had put them in, and began to </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb0a ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">peel it. She used to start at the top of the orange, where it had hung by its stalk from the tree, and </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb0b ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">peeled it in circles. As soon as she reached the bottom and there was no skin left, she quickly made </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb0c ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">a hole in the top with the tip of her knife and gave it to me to suck. But I soon learned how to peel </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb0d ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the oranges myself while I sat by the side of the road, beside my tray, which I had piled high with </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb0e ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the <a onclick="showDictionary('fruit'); return false;">fruit</a>. I did this job on behalf of my mother and so did not suck the oranges. I was peeling them </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb0f ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">to sell to other people. We made a huge fortune from the sale of oranges at the end of each season.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 yb10 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Sometimes I used to pick up the peel that Mother had cut off and play with it. She used to peel </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb11 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">an orange so well that the peel was very thin; I remember that I could almost see the sun shining </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb12 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">through it. When I held it up to the sunlight, I could see the little spots all over it, and when I dug </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb13 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">my nail into one of these, oil used to come out. Even though I did not like the taste of the oil, I did </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb14 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">like sticking my nail into the skin. I still do!</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 yb15 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">There was no time for playing when I was selling oranges. I had to arrange them on a table in </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb16 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">a <a onclick="showDictionary('conical'); return false;">conical</a> shape, with the most appetising and juicy ones at the very top, and I had to clean my </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb17 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">peeling knife to shine and glitter like glass in the sun. For some people, I peeled the oranges in </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb18 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the same way that my mother had peeled them for me. But for others, I held the orange in one </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb19 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">hand and used the knife in the other hand to just continue scraping the outer skin of the orange by </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb1a ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">turning it round and round until at the end of the process the orange looked greenish yellow.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 yb1b ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">After peeling or scraping like this, I made a hole with the tip of my knife at the head of the </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb1c ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">orange or sliced a bit off the top with the knife. Or I cut the orange into four pieces. The way I </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb1d ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">treated the orange depended on the wish of the customer.</div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 yb1e ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I still like oranges.

My brother, who </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb20 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">never eats them, has far more colds and fevers than I do. “An orange a day keeps the doctor away,” </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb21 ff4f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I often tell him, but he won’t listen to me. </div><div class="t m0 x28 h23 yb22 ff4e fs6 fc0 sc0 lsa">2<span class="fc2 lsb ws0 v2"> <span class="ff4c ls1 v3">Read the text again and answer these questions in your exercise book.</span></span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb23 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>1  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">What <a onclick="showDictionary('fruit'); return false;">fruits</a> are grown in the writer’s village?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb24 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>2  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">Why do many people like growing oranges?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb25 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>3  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">What was the air like under the trees?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb26 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>4  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">Why did the writer’s brother seldom help to pick oranges?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb27 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>5  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">Who ate the oranges that the writer peeled?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb28 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>6  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">When was there no time for playing?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb29 ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>7  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">The writer peeled the oranges as her mother did, but what other method did she use?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb2a ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>8  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">What does Vitamin C do for our bodies?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb2b ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0"> <span class="_ _63"> </span>9  <span class="_"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">What advice did the writer give us?</span></div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 yb2c ff4e fs6 fcf sc0 ls1 ws0">10 <span class="_ _6a"> </span><span class="ff4f fc2">Complete the sentence: <span class="ff52">The more oranges one eats, the fewer … one gets.</span></span></div></div><div class="t m0 xd h12 y14 ff53 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls1 ws0">M04_ENG_SB_ETHG9_0247_U04.indd   74<span class="_ _68"> </span>28/3/11   10:05:58 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
