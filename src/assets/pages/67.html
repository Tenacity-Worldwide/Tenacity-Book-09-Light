It is the most endangered animal of Ethiopia, with only about seven packs </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y93e ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">remaining, totalling roughly 550 adults. Although the Simien fox is mainly a solitary hunter of </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y93f ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">rodents, it lives in packs that share and defend an exclusive territory.

It weighs between 11–19 kilograms and </div><div class="t m0 x25 h20 y942 ff40 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">has small, widely spaced teeth.
