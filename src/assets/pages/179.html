In East Africa there is a Swahili version called Bao, while in Uganda it is called Omweso. It is thought to be the oldest board game in the world as we know that it was played in Ancient Egypt before 1,400 BC. It is played using holes scooped out of the ground and stones, or a row of pots, or with a wooden board and seeds. The basic Mancala game uses two rows of six holes with a store at each end. It is played by two players who face each other with the board between them. The row in front of a player and one of the stores belongs to that player. Each of the twelve holes is filled with three seeds. Taking it in turns with their opponent, the first player picks up the seeds in one of their holes and sows them around the board, moving in an anticlockwise direction. He or she puts seeds in all holes including their own store, but not their opponent’s store. If the player puts their last seed in an empty hole, he or she wins the seeds in their opponent’s hole directly opposite and puts them in their store. A player wins an extra turn if their last seed goes into their own store. Play continues until the holes on one player’s side are completely empty. That player then adds all the seeds left in their opponent’s holes to their store. The winner is the player with the most seeds in their store."></app-dictation><audio controls="" src="assets/audio/U9 E2 TGP 67 SBP 173 TG.mp3" style="position: absolute; height: 54px; top: 621px;"></audio><iframe src="assets/h5p/130 SB9 R3 L2 P173.html" style="position: absolute; height: 250px; top: 696px;"></iframe><iframe src="assets/h5p/131 SB9 R3 V0 P173.html" style="position: absolute; height: 480px; top: 954px;"></iframe></div>
