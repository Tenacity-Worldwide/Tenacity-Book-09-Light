Even so, there is a daunting obstacle to the monastery: the only means of access is a climb of </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20b3 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">25 metres up a sheer cliff, Monks lower a safety rope which visitors tie around their waist.

Though local people give food </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20bf ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and supplies, the monastic community is virtually self-sufficient, growing selected crops and rearing sheep </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20c0 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and goats for their milk and meat.
