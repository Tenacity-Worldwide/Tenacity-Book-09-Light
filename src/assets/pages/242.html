During my free time, I usually help my father on the farm. There is always a </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20e5 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">lot of work to be done on a farm. We grow onions, peppers, squash and cabbages and also have a couple of </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20e6 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">cows.  I help my father prepare the soil for planting, and I make sure there are no weeds among the growing </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20e7 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">plants. When the crops are ready, we harvest them and take them to the nearest town to sell in the market. </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20e8 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">We also keep bees on our farm and have half a dozen beehives which produce honey which we also sell in the </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20e9 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">market. I enjoy looking after the bees as they are very fascinating to watch. But we must be careful when we </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20ea ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">take away the honey combs from the hives or we could get badly stung!

Gradually, </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20ef ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I learnt how to make things and now I often make meals for the family. My speciality though is cakes. I made </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20f0 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">a cake once for my cousin’s birthday and a friend of hers who was at the party asked me to make one for her. </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20f1 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I now make birthday cakes quite often and I get paid for them! I suppose you could say my hobby not only </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20f2 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">pays for itself now but in fact it also makes me some money! But I have to buy expensive ingredients and I’ve </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20f3 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">bought one or two pieces of cooking equipment. So the money I make is not all profit. I also help look after </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y20f4 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">our animals and every morning before school I help milk the cow. </div></div><div class="t m0 xd h12 y14 ffc6 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls1 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG9_0247_Z01.indd   236<span class="_ _197"> </span>28/3/11   10:20:17 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
