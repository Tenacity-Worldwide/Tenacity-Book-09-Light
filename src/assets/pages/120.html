She said, before she took the </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1062 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 498.808px;">modelling training in Habesha Modelling, she could not even ‘walk’. Nardos believes the training </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1063 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 484.805px;">opened the door for her and enabled her to see what she has to offer. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y1064 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 470.802px;">So far, Nardos has won various crowns: <span class="ff76">Miss Virgin</span>, <span class="ff76">Miss Millennium</span>, <span class="ff76">Miss Coffee</span>, and <span class="ff76">Top Model</span>. </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1065 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 456.799px;">She told us proudly that she received five crowns in the five contests she entered in locally. She </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1066 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 442.796px;">has also travelled to Asia and the Middle East (China, Japan, Philippines and Dubai) to take part in </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1067 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 428.793px;">various contests. </div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y1068 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 414.79px;">Nardos enjoys reading books (especially those related to politics) and writing poems. She spends </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y1069 ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 400.787px;">her leisure time in quiet places, as well as swimming. She sees herself as a good listener. “I love to </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106a ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 386.784px;">listen to people, rather than talking to them.” Asked what it was like to win her first contest, Nardos </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106b ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 372.781px;">said, “It was the <span class="ff76">Miss Virgin</span> contest. I was really excited and proud to have received the crown and </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106c ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 358.778px;">to promote the virtue of being a virgin.” </div><div class="t m0 x2f h20 y106d ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 344.775px;">Many parents are not happy to send their children to modelling and beauty contests, believing </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106e ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 330.772px;">that they will fall behind in their education and become vulnerable to bad influences. We asked </div><div class="t m0 x23 h20 y106f ff6f fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0" style="bottom: 316.769px;">Nardos if she had met any such resistance. Nardos replied, “No, my parents believed in me.
