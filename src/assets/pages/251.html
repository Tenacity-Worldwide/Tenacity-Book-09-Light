Everyone was dying, so my parents left with my two older </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2255 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">sisters to search for food and water. But they died of malnutrition in a resettlement camp. A few weeks </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2256 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">later, I was run over by a car. It was days before I could get to see a doctor. When I finally did, my leg was so </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2257 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">infected, it had to be amputated. So I lost my leg and my family, but still, I was one of the lucky ones. I was </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2258 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">picked up and taken to a local orphanage by an aid worker. I used to cry with jealousy and frustration when </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2259 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">other children were adopted from the orphanage and wonder why I was never chosen. But the carers at the </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y225a ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">orphanage taught me to believe in myself. They funded me through school, where I excelled academically, </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y225b ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">and they provided ongoing financial support so I could train for a profession. I have a prosthetic limb, but I’m </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y225c ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">alive.” Today, proud and independent, Birtukan speaks without a shred of self-pity, and is optimistic about </div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y225d ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">the future.<span class="ffbf"> </span>“I work for the government’s education division and now have a boyfriend who loves me as I am. </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y225e ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">It makes me so proud to be able to support myself financially.

Remembering his childhood he says, “When I tried to play </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2263 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">with my neighbours’ children their parents forbade them to play with me, thinking that my disability was </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y2264 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">contagious.
