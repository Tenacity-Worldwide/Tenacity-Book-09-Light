A few months later one of our teachers, Mr Hailu, </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20c7 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">started a computer club and I was the first to join! Now I’m on the club committee. Of course, we only have </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20c8 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">one computer, but we have to take turns. Mr Hailu has taught us some basic things like how to turn it on and </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20c9 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">off, how to create a document and also how to use the Internet. I now send emails to my cousin in the south </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20ca ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">of the country. Everyone’s favourite thing though is computer games! We aren’t allowed to spend much time </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20cb ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">playing them as that’s not what the club is for. Mr Hailu is always showing us something new about what the </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20cc ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">computer can do and I am very interested. We have to pay a small subscription every month to be in the club, </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20cd ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">but that’s it. I would like to have a computer of my own at home but that would be far too expensive.</div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20f5 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">Zebida</div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20f6 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I don’t have a proper hobby but the thing I like doing best in my free time is reading. I read anything that </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20f7 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">I can get hold of! I go to the school library and change my book every week. I love detective stories and </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20f8 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">romantic stories. I also read books about things like nature. I read the newspaper, too. My sister usually </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20d2 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">brings one in when she comes home from work. Then I collect magazines as well. I’m not allowed to buy new </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20d3 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">ones, but when I can, I buy an old one and add it to my collection. My mother is getting annoyed by all the </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20d4 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">magazines, comics and books in my room; she says I should sell them. But when I have nothing new to read I </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y20d5 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">read some of my old things again, so I don’t want to sell them.</div><div class="t m0 x21 h87 y20f9 ffbf fs3e fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">UNIT 4 Food for health</div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20fa ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">A4.3 Quiz</div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20fb ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">1<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _31"> </span>This vegetable is very hot and can burn your mouth if you are not careful!</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20fc ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">2<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _31"> </span>The middle part of this is yellow and can grow into a baby chick.</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20fd ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">3 <span class="ffc0"> <span class="_ _b6"> </span>Mice like to eat this, and it helps to make your bones strong because it contains a lot of calcium.</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20fe ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">4<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _31"> </span>These green leaves keep you healthy and are full of iron.</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y20ff ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">5<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _31"> </span>This fruit has a large stone in the centre and is very juicy!</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y2100 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">6<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _31"> </span>Having too much of these white crystals makes your teeth rot!</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y2101 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">7<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _31"> </span>Babies love to drink this and it helps keep your bones strong.</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y2102 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">8 <span class="ffc0"> <span class="_ _b6"> </span>Eating too many of these is not good for your weight or your teeth!</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y2103 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">9 <span class="ffc0"> <span class="_ _b6"> </span>This green vegetable gives you lots of vitamins.</span></div><div class="t m0 x21 h1c y2104 ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1">10<span class="ffc0 ws0"> <span class="_ _6e"></span>Some people say this is a fruit, others that it is a vegetable.

A person who does not get enough food, or </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y210b ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">gets food of the wrong kind, will be sick and weak. Now there are three main food types. First of all, I would </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y210c ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">like to mention protein. Protein provides the body with material for growth and repair. Secondly, there are </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y210d ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">carbohydrates – carbohydrates provide the body with materials for energy and warmth.
