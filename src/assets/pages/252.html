Surprisingly, I didn’t feel any pain, probably because the nerves in my leg were </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y2279 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">burned.

When we reached the hospital, 25 minutes away, they told me I couldn’t be treated there. I had to </div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y227d ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">go to another hospital that could help me. </div><div class="t m0 x27 h1c y227e ffbf fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">What did you do before the accident?<span class="ffc0"> </span></div><div class="t m0 x27 h20 y227f ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">My mother died when I was five years old so I was always working, doing odd jobs like shoe shining.
