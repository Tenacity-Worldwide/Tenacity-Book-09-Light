New York City is famous as a financial, cultural, </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y21ac ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">transportation, and manufacturing centre.

Most of the urban development is on Kowloon </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y21bf ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">Peninsula, along the northern edge of Hong Kong Island, and in the New Territories. The high density and </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y21c0 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">tall skyline of Hong Kong’s urban area is due to a lack of available space, with the average distance from the </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y21c1 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">harbour front to the steep hills of Hong Kong Island only 1.3 kilometres, much of it reclaimed land. This lack </div><div class="t m0 x21 h20 y21c2 ffc0 fs6 fc2 sc0 ls1 ws0">of space caused a demand for dense, high-rise offices and housing, and has resulted in 7,650 skyscrapers. </div></div><div class="t m0 xd h12 y14 ffc6 fs8 fc1 sc0 ls1 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG9_0247_Z01.indd   241<span class="_ _197"> </span>28/3/11   10:20:17 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>
